in this college folder , there are projects which are taught by alex sir 

such as food app 


??????   venv kaha banauu ?????  
in college folder , or inside food-App-project-1 wala folder
or like - food-App > venv , my site > food , mysite , ... 

then run the pizza project

then update the repo_info.txt folder    ( how to activate wala part)

then push on github 

then on my laptop - make venv for food proj , and make venv in geeky_shows wala proj


and dont push or pull the Venv since - laptop is window and codespaces is linux so conflict hoga and venv will not workout .
