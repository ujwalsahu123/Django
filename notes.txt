Django Project Structure â€” Overview
When you create a Django project using django-admin startproject, Django sets up a specific folder structure that helps organize your codebase clearly. This structure separates the core project configuration, apps, management tools, and resources into a clean hierarchy. At the top level, you have the outer project folder, and inside it is an inner project folder that holds configuration files. Alongside it, you can add Django apps, virtual environments, static files, and more.

outer project folder it is the root directory where you create or initialize your Django project. It usually holds all key components required to run and manage the project. Some of the common items in this folder include:





ðŸ”¹ manage.py
Located in the outer project folder

Command-line utility to manage Django project

Used for: runserver, migrate, makemigrations, createsuperuser, startapp, etc.

Internally loads the projectâ€™s settings module

Acts as entry point for Django project commands

ðŸ”¹ App Folders
Created using python manage.py startapp appname

Represents a specific feature/module (e.g., blog, users, api)

Contains: models.py, views.py, admin.py, apps.py, tests.py, migrations/

Must be registered in INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py

Can have own urls.py, templates/, static/ folders

Reusable across projects


db.sqlite3: This is the default SQLite database file that Django generates automatically if you're using the built-in SQLite database. It lives at the root by default.

static/: An optional folder where you can store project-wide static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images.
media/ , requirements.txt , git ignor , etc 


ðŸ”¹ Inner Project Folder
Inside the outer folder, Django creates an inner project folder â€” typically named the same as your project (but it can be different if you choose). This folder is responsible for the core configuration of the entire project. It contains important files like the settings module, URL routing system, and deployment interfaces (WSGI and ASGI). This folder is not an app; it doesnâ€™t contain any views, models, or templates. Instead, it serves as the projectâ€™s control center, providing the foundational structure on which your apps run. 
 



 
 __init__.py
The __init__.py file is a special Python file that tells Python to treat the folder itâ€™s in as a package. This is crucial for allowing Django to import settings, URLs, or any other modules inside the inner project folder (for example, indoor.settings). Without this file, Python wouldnâ€™t recognize the folder as part of the importable project structure.

Although the file is often empty, it plays an essential behind-the-scenes role in keeping your project organized and functioning properly. Itâ€™s a standard part of any Python package and is not Django-specific.

ðŸ”¹ settings.py
The settings.py file is the configuration hub for your Django project. It contains all the global settings that tell Django how to behave. Some of the key configurations here include:

DEBUG: Controls whether the project is in development mode or production.

INSTALLED_APPS: A list of apps Django should know about and include.

DATABASES: Tells Django how to connect to your database (SQLite, PostgreSQL, etc.).

MIDDLEWARE: A stack of components that process requests and responses globally.

STATIC_URL, MEDIA_URL: Define how static files (CSS/JS) and media files (uploads) are handled.

This file essentially acts as the control panel for your entire project. You can also customize it by splitting it into multiple settings files for development, production, or testing environments.
ðŸ”¹ urls.py
This is the URL dispatcher. It maps each incoming URL (like /, /about, /admin/) to a view function or another appâ€™s URL config. It controls how users interact with your site by telling Django what code to run for a given path. This file acts as the central router for your project.
